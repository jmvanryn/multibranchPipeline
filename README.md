# multibranchPipeline

Ok, Below you find my opus.. (lol not really) but still this is my attempt to take a mess and automate it. Those who are willing, any advice would be appreciated.

The project all lives in one git repo. very much like https://github.com/jmvanryn/multibranchPipeline

some of my questions are..

1. could I be doing some of this better? how do I use Global variables?
2. you can see I'm defining some things twice. why does GIT pull twice?
3. is there a way to get the cobertura report plugin to work?
4. env.BRANCH_NAME gives me "feature/FeatureName" is there a DSL/Groovy way to trim it to just FeatureName?
